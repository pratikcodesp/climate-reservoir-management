"""
NOTE: To properly implement this with custom HTML templates while still using Dash,
you have two main approaches:

1. Pure Dash approach (recommended):
   - Continue using the layout.py file you've already created
   - Dash will handle rendering the HTML and inserting all components

2. Hybrid Flask-Dash approach:
   - Create a Flask app
   - Serve your custom HTML templates via Flask routes
   - Mount Dash components inside the HTML using specific div IDs
   - This is more complex and generally only needed for very specific use cases

The code above shows how you would implement the hybrid approach, but for most cases,
the pure Dash approach is easier to maintain.

For now, we recommend using the layout.py approach since Dash already handles creating
all the necessary HTML and JavaScript for a reactive UI.
